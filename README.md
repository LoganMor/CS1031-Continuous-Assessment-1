# CS1031-Continuous-Assessment-1

Design Report

This is the Design Report for the Hometown Website created for CS1031 CA2. In this document i will cover the design choices and challenged that i faces during the designing of the website

Design Choices

The design of the website is to look pleasing on the eyes. Not strain the eyes with long walls of text, having soft, pleasing colours, having a consistent view and overall being simple. The main colour is pink, which is reflective of a part of strichen itself. Although not explained in the website, Strichen often has pink skies in morning or evening, known as Shepard's Delight or Shepard's Warning depending on the time of day. The colour choice is to reflect this, so that a resident would see this and be reminded of part of their home. The colour was also a soft colour, which is bright, but does not glare on the user. The logo is also pink with darker pink on the edges to help it stand out.

I used a simple navigation, a horizontal navigation bar across the top in a soft black. This is so that the navigation stands out at the top of the page, not getting in the way of any information. 

I chose a simple layout, having the banner on the top left of the page with the title attatched to it. Then all the information beneath it. This is so the layout is simple and easy to follow. Originally i was going to have the Title in a different background colour, the same as the background of the image, but i felt like this causes potential strain on the eyes when it was put into practice, so i decided that having one pane of colour on the layout was a better decision. 

Challenges

The main challenge i faced was time, due to other assessments and some technical issues, i had a shorter timeframe than i would have thought. Because of this i put too much time into the first stages of the assessment, and then did not have much time for the later stages. If i were to do this again, i would space out my time to account for potential technical issues. 

Another challenge i faced was that my town is small and remote, not much information was available to work with. There was difficulty making design choices reflecting on the town itself, and i could not find a motto for the banner, instead having to use the motto of the primary school, as this felt fitting for the story of Strichen. 

Lastly, my Github would not link to my Codio, meaning that using Git was difficult. If i were to repeat this assessment, i would figure this out before starting.
