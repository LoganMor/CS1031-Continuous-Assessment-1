				<h2> Strichen Stone Circle </h2>
				<img src="Stonecircle.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
				<p> Reference 1 </p>
				<blockquote> The Strichen Stone Circle is hidden away, you may need to use google maps or be shown where it is. Today's visitor finds a ring of standing stones measuring some 15m in diameter, rising from a continuous circle of much smaller stones. The circle has quite the history that is worth diving in to, the circle has been demolished and recreated multiple times. the original circle was thought to be 4000 year olds. It is quite a sad story, but the current circle is worth the visit! </blockquote>
				<h2> The Mormond Inn </h2>
				<img src="Mormond.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

				<blockquote> The Mormond Inn is family run, and has annual days of fun with bouncy castles and other kid friendly activities. For day to day activities the Mormond Inn has Sky Sports, so many relax and have a drink while watching the football or darts.

				<blockquote> The Old Auction Room is an antique shop that also serves food. The antiques are some of the best around, and any kind of hunter can find what they are looking for, from toys to furniture to art.
