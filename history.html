        <p> Strichen was originally founded in 1764, built as an expansion to the existing settlement of Mormond. In an advert on the 21st of november 1763 in the Aberdeen Journal, Alexander Fraser, the founder of Strichen, offered "<i>Plenty of stone, lime, and an inexhaustible supply of moss, a weekly market and four great fairs annually</i>" and sought "<i>all persons concerned in linen manufacture as there is plenty of yarn already spun in the [area].</i>" As an incentive he is said to have offered Â£100 to the first person to finish building their house in Strichen</p>    
		<p> By 1800, Strichen was a center for a textiles industry including a bleachfield and mills. The town processed flax grown in local fields and produced linen. Also around this time, a new parish church was constructed to replace the Mormond Parish Church. The North Church, which still sees use today, was built in 1893 </p>
		<p> Strichen Town House was constructed in 1819, still standing today the structure has a design inspired by Scottish tolbooths. It originally had open sides to provide a market area, although now its sides are closed </p>
		<p> At a similar time to this, the original Strichen House was being constructed a mile to the South-West, the mansion was finished in 1821. In 1950 it changed hands to William Baird, who made his fortune in Iron. During the 1900s the place was no longer a residence and used as storage. Now it is abandonded</p>
		<p> During 1865, Strichen was given its railway station on a line from Maud to Fraserburgh, this station is no longer around</p>
		<p> The original name of the settlement here, Mormond, is also associated with Mormond Hill, which rises to a height of 750ft two and a half miles north-east of Strichen. Today these are mostly concerned with civilian communications. From the 1960s to the beginning of the 1990s, Mormond Hill formed part of a chain of NATO communications bases. The hill also has a White Horse laid out in quartz on its south-west side as a memorial to a fallen sergeant. On its east side there is a larger white stag laid out in similar material. this is unrelated, as it was constructed to celebrate the laird's wedding </p>
